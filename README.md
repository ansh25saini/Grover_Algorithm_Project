## üìì  Description / Internal Working
This project aims at solving a dinner problem (boolean satisfiability problem ) using Grover's algorithm. 

SAT(Boolean Satisfiability Problem) is the problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given boolean formula. It asks whether the variables of a given boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula evaluates to TRUE. If this is the case, the formula is called satisfiable. On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is FALSE for all possible variable assignments and the formula is unsatisfiable.

A Boolean SAT problem can be solved by determining all the input combinations that fit into a boolean function such that the output is true. Since searching through the combinations is needed, Grover's algorithm is used.

Grover‚Äôs algorithm, also known as the quantum search algorithm, is a quantum algorithm designed by Los Grover in 1996 to search for an element in an unsorted array quadratically faster ( O(sqrt(N) ) : Time Complexity) than the classical linear search for large datasets. This project aims at solving a particular boolean satisfiability problem (dinner problem) using Grover's algorithm.

### Problem Statement
Frank wants to throw a dinner party to celebrate Alice and Bob‚Äôs engagement. He is also considering inviting their mutual friends Charles, Dave and Eve. However, he is aware that Charles will come to the party only if Dave comes without Eve. Frank wants to know what possible combinations of invitations he can write for his friends Alice, Bob, Charles, Dave and Eve.

Help Frank calculate all the possible combinations using Grover‚Äôs algorithm.

### Working
1. Create 5 quantum channel labelled as qi, i ‚àà {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. where qo represents presence of Alice, q1 represents presence of Bob, q2 represents presence of Charles, q3 represents presence of Dave, q4 represents presence of Eve. Apply Hadamard gate to each channel - it creates superposition of every possible states.
2. Create an oracle that flips a state if it satisfies the problem statement.
3. Reflect all the states about the mean and amplify the amplitudes of the possible states that satisfy the problem statement.
4. Run the final circuit on Statevector Simulator Backend - to calculate amplitudes, and Qasm Simulator - to print histogram of the frequency of the states.
